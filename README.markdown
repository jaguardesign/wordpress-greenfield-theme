## Wordpress "Greenfield" Theme

A "bare" theme for developers to use as the basis of creating new themes.

**greenfield** (n): a project that lacks any constraints imposed by prior work

### Features

* DRY: HTML markup separated out into template partials for easy reuse across multiple PHP files.
* Web designer friendly: HTML and PHP as separate as possible. Designers can edit template partials without having to muck through a lot of PHP.
* Three sidebars available: traditional column sidebar, header widgets, and footer widgets
* Fast JavaScript loading through head.js
* HTML5 doctype and validated markup. Default markup is backwards-compatible: no HTML5-specific tags
* html5resetcss: HTML5 updated version of Eric Meyer's CSS Reset (http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/)
